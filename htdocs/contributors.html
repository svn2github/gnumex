    <h3>The Story of Gnumex as Told by Kristj&#225;n J&#243;nasson</h3>
	<p>This was derived from an email from Kristj&#225;n J&#243;nasson in 2013 (you can find the email on the mailing list):</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 120px;">
      <p>Ton Van Overbeek (European Space Agency; retired) wrote the original version according to the [old] html documentation.&nbsp;
      Matthew Brett (MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge) wrote the first documentation from 2000 and 2001, and he
      gives credit to Mumit Khan (BRAC University, Bangladesh) and also thanked Mark Levedahl, Lars Gregerson, Christian Merkwirth.
      Matthew was then and for some years after that the main maintainer along with Jonathan R. Birge (MIT).</p>
      
	  <p>Kristjan Jonasson, University of Iceland, made some contributions and refactoring during the years 2007-2009 (including
      making Gnumex work for Matlab version 7.4). When he began work on Gnumex, the main source file, gnumex.m, listed Ton, Matthew
      and Mumit as the authors, and the two administrators of Gnumex at Sourceforge were Matthew and Jonathan.  Gnumex.m actually says:&nbsp; &#8220;Facility for added libraries, Fortran
      engine compilation Matthew Brett 3/5/2000 (DB), 9/7/2001 (PJ), 19/7/02 (RBH). Perhaps DB, PJ and RBH are initials of
      additional contributors?</p>
      
      <p>In about 2010, 64 bits began to become the norm and it transpired that Gnumex didn&#8217;t work with 64 bit Matlab. Gregory
      R. Lee (Case Western Reserve University) wrote the first patch to solve this and posted it on the Gnumex mailing list. The
      issue was then solved independently by Tony Kelman (UC Berkeley) in 2012 and Richard Crozier (University of Edinburgh) in
      2013. They both joined the Gnumex admin list in 2013, and in September 2013 they merged their solutions and incorporated the
      result into the Sourceforge Gnumex version.</p>
