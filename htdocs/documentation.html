<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>A knowledge of MATLAB is necessary.&nbsp; A knowledge of simple
compilation of C, C++, or Fortran is helpful.&nbsp; Also, if you have
worked with Cygwin, MinGW, MinGW-w32, or MinGW-w64 that is helpful.<br />
</p>

<p>The main attractions for using GCC for Windows over other compilers is the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GCC is free as no money and free as in speech.</li>
  <li>Gfortran is the only Fortran compiler on windows that is
free.&nbsp; The only other option with MATLAB seems to be the Intel
Fortran compiler.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Compiling with GCC may allow the same source file to be used on both Unix and Windows operating systems.</li>
</ol>
There are two main approaches with GCC on Windows signified by Cygwin and <span style="font-style: italic;">Min</span>imalist <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>CC for <span style="font-style: italic;">W</span>indows
(MinGW).&nbsp; MinGW approach is to link to Microsoft run-time
libraries, which result in fast executables, but restricts
compatibility with GCC on Unix.&nbsp; In contrast, Cygwin GCC links to
a dynamic link library, cygwin1.dll, which provides a Unix style API
that allows access to many more Unix routines than the Microsoft
run-time libraries.&nbsp; Cygwin is often slower but has better
compatibility.&nbsp; Cygwin1.dll is required on the PATH when calling
your executable or library. See the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/faq/faq_toc.html">Cygwin FAQ</a> for more on the Cygwin API and how the Unix emulation works.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
To make matters more complicated, MinGW-w64 is a different project than
MinGW.&nbsp; The MinGW-w64 project has support for both 32 bit and 64
compiling on Windows but MinGW only supports 32 bit. MinGW-w64 forked
the MinGW and added 64 bit support.&nbsp; You can use either with
Gnumex.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As an added complication, you can also do Mingw compiles using the
Cygwin tools, i.e. use the Cygwin tools to link to the Microsoft
libraries. This is achieved by passing a flag to the Cygwin gcc,
-mno-cygwin. This is refered to as Cygwin/mingw compiling. There are
some problems with this option. Although the gnumex utilities here do
support Cygwin-mingw compiles, I would strongly suggest using Mingw
instead. There have been rumblings on the Cygwin mailing list about
discontinuation for -mno-cygwin support, but it is still being updated.<br />
<br />
Note that Cygwin does not play well with MATLAB.&nbsp; If you use
Cygwin without -mno-cygwin flag, only GCC 3.2 or below is
supported.&nbsp; The -mno-cygwin flag is deprecated.&nbsp; MinGW or
MinGW-w64 is recommended.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
 <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>content</p>
<h3>Installation and Setup<br />
</h3>
<p>Configuring Gnumex requires either Cygwin or MinGW to be installed 1st.&nbsp; Note the recommend compilers are MinGW or MinGW-w64 (both 32 or 64 bit).&nbsp; Cygwin<br />
</p>
<h4>Installing MinGW or MinGW-w64</h4>
<p>There are muliple flavors of MinGW and MinGW-w64.&nbsp; Two different links to different MinGW-w64 projects are in the <a href="links.html">Links</a>
section as examples that contributors have used.&nbsp; If you plan to
work with 32 bit MATLAB, get the 32 bit compiler.&nbsp; For 64 bit
MATLAB, get a 64 bit compiler.&nbsp; Note that TDM-GCC installs both
the 64-bit and 32-bit in the same directory;&nbsp; do not attempt this
with other versions of MinGW-w64.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; As an example, here is instructions for the compiler from <a href="http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=fortran">equations.com</a>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download gcc-4.7.3-64.exe from <a href="http://www.equation.com/servlet/equation.cmd?fa=fortran">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Run
gcc-4.7.3-64.exe and follow the instructions.&nbsp; Install to the
default location of C:\gcc . Please note that the installer modifies
the PATH environmental variable (if you don't know what this is, google
"windows environmental variable").<br />
  </li>
  <li>Optionally,
create the environmental variable "MINGW_HOME" pointed to the install
directory C:\gcc .&nbsp; You do this by going to Control
Panel--&gt;System--&gt;Advanced System Settings--&gt;Environmental
Variables as shown below.<img style="width: 801px; height: 580px;" alt="MINGW Enviromental Variable Set" src="MINGW_Set.jpg" /></li></ol>
<h4>Installing Cygwin or Cygwin64</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The version that you want is available via the Ptolemy cywgin
page. Get the CygwinDevel.exe version from there, and install as
described in that page.<br />
