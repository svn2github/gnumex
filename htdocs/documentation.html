<h3 id="L47">Preface and Background</h3>

<p>A knowledge of MATLAB is necessary.&nbsp; A knowledge of simple compilation
of C, C++, or Fortran is helpful.&nbsp; Also, if you have worked with MinGW,
MinGW-w32, or MinGW-w64 that is helpful.</p>

<p>The main attractions for using GCC for Windows over other compilers is the
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GCC is free as no money and free as in speech.</li>
  <li>Gfortran is the only Fortran compiler on windows that is free.&nbsp; The
    only other option with MATLAB seems to be the Intel Fortran compiler.</li>
  <li>Compiling with GCC may allow the same source file to be used on both Unix
    and Windows operating systems.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two methods used to compile code using GCC on Windows.&nbsp; These methods are <span style="font-style: italic;">Min</span>imalist <span style="font-style: italic;">G</span>CC for <span style="font-style: italic;">W</span>indows
(MinGW) or the Cygwin environment.&nbsp; MinGW is a native
implementation of the GCC compiler and some other tools. MinGW links
directly to Microsoft run-time libraries. Cygwin provides a unix-like
environment in windows. Programs are compiled to run in this
environment and link to a Cygwin dll called cygwin1.dll. The MinGW
approach results in faster executables, but
restricts compatibility with GCC on Unix.&nbsp; Cygwin produces slower
executables, but allows a larger set of Unix-style tools.&nbsp; With
Cygwin,&nbsp;
the cygwin1.dll must be on the PATH when calling your executable or
library.&nbsp;
See the <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/cygwin/faq/">Cygwin
FAQ</a> for more on the Cygwin API and how the Unix emulation works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2007 a new project, MinGW-w64 was released as a fork from the
original MinGW project. &nbsp; MinGW-w64 added 64 bit support.&nbsp;
However, the MinGW-w64 project has support for both 32 bit and 64
compiling on
Windows but MinGW only supports 32 bit.&nbsp; A brief history of why
MinGW-w64 forked MinGW is available <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/History">here</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>As an added complication, you can also do MinGW compiles using the Cygwin
tools. i.e. use the Cygwin tools to link to the Microsoft libraries. This is
achieved by passing a flag to the Cygwin gcc, -mno-cygwin. This is refered to
as Cygwin/mingw compiling. There are some problems with this option. The old
gnumex utilities do support Cygwin-mingw compiles, however it is strongly
suggested to use MinGW instead.</p>

<p>Note that Cygwin does not play well with MATLAB.&nbsp; If you use
Cygwin
without -mno-cygwin flag, only GCC 3.2 or below works.&nbsp; The
-mno-cygwin
flag is deprecated.&nbsp; Reports of Cygwin crashing MATLAB are common
on the
mailing list.&nbsp; Therefore, MinGW or MinGW-w64 is recommended.&nbsp;
Support
for cygwin updates will no longer be made after Gnumex 2.05.&nbsp; If
you need
Gnumex to use Cygwin, then use an older version of Gnumex.&nbsp; More
documentation on Cygwin can be found on the old documentation <a href="oldDocumentation/index.html">here</a>.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="L107">Prerequisite: Installing MinGW or MinGW-w64</h3>

<p>Configuring Gnumex requires either MinGW or MinGW-w64 to be installed
first.&nbsp; Cygwin is no longer supported.&nbsp; No further updates will be
made for Cygwin. If need help with Cygwin please see the old website <a href="oldDocumentation/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are muliple flavors of MinGW and MinGW-w64.&nbsp; Two different links
to different MinGW-w64 projects are in the <a href="links.html">Links</a>
section as examples that contributors have used.&nbsp; If you plan to work with
32 bit MATLAB, get the 32 bit compiler.&nbsp; For 64 bit MATLAB, get a 64 bit
compiler.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; As an example, here is instructions for the compiler from TDM-GCC:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download TDM-GCC package from <a href="http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/">here</a>.&nbsp; If you have 32bit
    MATLAB, get the 32 bit TDM-GCC package.&nbsp; If you have 64bit MATLAB get
    the 64bit version.</li>
  <li>Run the installer and follow the instructions.&nbsp; Install to the
    default location of TDM-GCC-32 or TDM-GCC-64. Please note that the
    installer modifies the PATH environmental variable (if you don't know what
    this is, google "windows environmental variable").</li>
  <li>That's it.&nbsp; Nothing to it.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="L131">Installing and Setting Up Gnumex</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain the latest version of Gnumex from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex/files/">Download</a>
  section.</li>
  <li>Unpack the archive (using tar, winzip, whatever) into a directory of your
    choice - say ...\Documents\gnumex. You now have: a Matlab install routine,
    gnumex.m; a couple of mex file supporting routines (shortpath.dll,
    uigetpath.dll); a hacked version of the windows dll utility, dlltool ( <a href="dlltool.html">click to see past issue with dlltool</a>), and some perl
    scripts.</li>
  <li>To setup Gnumex, run the gnumex script from the install directory (e.g
    ...\Documents\gnumex).&nbsp; A Matlab figure window comes up, with a
    variety of options, which should look a little like this:<br>
    <img alt="Gnumex dialog" src="gnumex.png" style="width: 669px; height: 578px;" title="Gnumex MATLAB dialog"></li>
  <li>Fill
in the dialog window and then click "Make options file."&nbsp; Gnumex
will use all of the filled information to generate a new batch file--
usually called mexopts.bat--that Matlab can use to mex code.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="L150">Usage</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span class="option">MinGW root directory (maybe blank):</span> This
    should point to the base directory of MinGW or MinGW-w64. For example,

<h3 id="L196">The Code</h3>

<p>The main piece of code is the <code>gnumex.m</code> function.&nbsp; Below is
a description of the contents of <code>gnumex.m</code><img alt="gnumex.m" src="FoldedCode.svg"> </p>

<h3 id="L201">Cygwin Support</h3>

<p>Cygwin still works but no there is no plan to maintain support with Cygwin. If you need more information on Gnumex with Cygwin, please
see the old website <a href="oldDocumentation/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="L206">Special Topics</h3>

<h4 id="L208">Fortran Compiling</h4>

<p>Fortran compiling seems to have caused the more problems than the other
languages with Gnumex over the years. Currently, Gnumex will work with gfortran for 32bit.
Old versions of g77, g95, gfortran also work. 64-bit fortran has worked in some cases but
still needs work.</p>

<h5 id="L215">Fortran File Extensions</h5>
  <p>Fortran 77 programs and Fortran 90/95 programs in fixed source form should
  have extension .f, but free form Fortran 95 programs must have extension .f90
  (the compilers support also the extension .f95, but Matlab's mex command does
  not, and .f90 is generally preferred over .f95 anyway).</p>

<h5 id="L221">Case Options and Trailing Underscores</h5>
<p>In contrast gfortran does not offer the -fcase switches, and in fact defaults
to the behaviour of -fcase-lower. To circumvent the problem that this causes
one can use BIND(C,NAME...) clauses in interface blocks for the mx and mex
functions, e.g. BIND(C,NAME='MXGETPR') (the mx and mex functions are probably
written in C anyway). The demonstration programs give more details.</p>

<h5 id="L230">Mex Functions With Character String Arguments</h5>
<p>gfortran seems to have a different mechanism for passing character
strings, and the Fortran versions of these functions do not work. Thus
mexinterface_c.f90 binds them to the corresponding C-functions (with mixed
case names). This means that strings passed to them from gfortran must have
an ascii zero appended, viz:</p>
       <p><code>call mexprintf('A message'//char(0))<br>
       call mexerrmsgtxt('An error occurred'//char(10)//char(0))</code></p>

<h5 id="L239">Pointers and %VAL</h5>
<p>Matlab sends integer memory addresses (pointers) to the gateway routine and
these must be translated to arrays. In g77 the construct %val may be used, but
in g95 it is possible to use native pointers. Again the demonstration programs
give the details.</p>

<h5 id="L246">Example Fortran Programs</h5>
<p>The demo Fortran programs that come with Matlab some use the %val construct
but others use instead the functions mxCopyPtrToXXX and mxCopyXXXToPtr. With
g77 it is much simpler to stick with the %val construct. The example gateway
routine of Matlab, yprimefg.f (in <matlabroot>\extern\examples\mex) is
totally incompatible with all the gnu Fotran compilers. However with Gnumex
there are routines, yprime77.f and yprime95.f90 which are compatible. The
first one calls the computational routine in yprimef.f, but the second
contains a module with a computational routine that is called (the yprimef.f
that comes with Matlab is actually g77-compatible, but for convenience a
similar routine is enclosed with Gnumex). The demonstartion programs are
located in a subfolder, examples, in the folder where Gnumex is installed.</p>

<p>For Fortran 90 there is an additional demonstration program, powerit.f90,
which carries out power iteration (to find dominant eigenvalue) with a sparse
matrix. The Fortran 90 demo programs include two modules, mexinterface_c.f90
and mexinterface.f90. The second one is simpler but does not work with
gfortran (because of the -fcase issue discussed above), but the second one
works for both compilers. These modules define the interface to those mx-
and mex-	 which are used by the demo programs, and if other functions
are needed their interface must be added here.</p>

<h5 id="L269">Running the Fortran Examples</h5>
<p>Use the html pages stored with each set of examples for the specified
compiler you are using.</p>

<h4 id="L249">Linking to LAPACK/BLAS libraries</h4>

<p>Mex files doing a lot of matrix algebra are likely to benefit from linking
to the highly optimized <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> and <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> routines. Linking steps are
described in a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/calling-lapack-and-blas-functions-from-mex-files.html">Mathworks
BLAS/LAPACK help page.</a> For gcc, you simply follow the instructions on that
page, but use the Microsoft MSVC++ import libraries to link; e.g, from the
matlab prompt:</p>

<p><code>mex myfile.c libmwlapack.lib</code></p>

<p>You may on occasion want to link a c file to a fortran object file, which
then links to BLAS or LAPACK; in this case, compile the fortran file with the
"-fno-underscoring" flag; e.g - outside matlab:</p>

<p><code>g77 -fno-underscoring -c my_fortran_file.f</code></p>

<p>Then, inside matlab:</p>

<p><code>mex myfile.c my_fortran_file.o
c:/matlab6p5/extern/lib/win32/microsoft/msvc60/libmwlapack.lib</code></p>

<h4 id="L272"><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId545751" id="mozTocId545751">Using Autotools with Gnumex</a> </h4>

<p>Christopher Hulbert has kindly written a page on using <a href="autotools/index.html">GNU autotools with gnumex</a>. GNU autotools
(autoconf and automake) allow you to script platform independent compilation
which is often useful for larger projects.</p>
