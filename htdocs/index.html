<H1><A NAME="gnumex_top"></A>Compiling Matlab mex files with gcc for Windows</H1>

This page is designed to explain how to install the GNU compiler
compiler collection (gcc) for Windows, to compile matlab mex and other
files.  It was originally written for the b20.1 release. The current
release (as of August 2004) is cygwin 1.5.10-3.

<p>There are two attractions to using gcc for Windows over other
compilers. The first is that gcc is free. The second is that gcc,
particularly Cygwin gcc (see below), can emulate Unix functionality
within Windows, so you may be able to use the same c or c++ mex source
files on Unix and Windows.  The last is that you may also be
able to use gcc to compile Fortran programs.</p>

<h2><A NAME="mingw_cygwin"></A>Mingw and Cygwin</h2>

<p>There are two main options when using gcc with Windows: <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MINimalist Gcc for Windows (Mingw)</a>,
and the gcc that comes as part of the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin package</a>.  The
differences between these two, and some other versions of gcc for
Windows, are explained in a page on <a href="http://www.mingw.org/x86-win32-ports.shtml"> gcc versions for
Windows</a>.  In brief, the Mingw approach is to simply link to the
Microsoft run-time libararies, which results in fast executables, but
a restricted compatibility with gcc for Unix.  In contrast, the Cygwin
gcc compiles link to a dynamic link library, cygwin1.dll, which
provides a Unix style API that allows access to many more Unix
routines than are available with the Microsoft libraries. See the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/faq/faq_toc.html">Cygwin
FAQ</a> for more on the Cygwin API and how the Unix emulation
works. Cygwin gcc executables tend to be a little slower, and require
that the Cygwin1.dll file be on the Windows PATH.  Cygwin comes
complete with many useful Unix tools, such as the bash shell, and all
the usual Unix utilities.</p>

As an added complication, you can also do Mingw compiles using the
Cygwin tools, i.e. use the Cygwin tools to link to the Microsoft
libraries. This is achieved by passing a flag to the Cygwin gcc, <a href="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/%7Ekhan/software/gnu-win32/mno-cygwin-howto.txt">-mno-cygwin</a>.
I refer to this as Cygwin/mingw compiling. <a name="#cyg-min-mess">There are some problems with this
option</a>. Although the gnumex utilities here do support Cygwin-mingw
compiles, I would strongly suggest using Mingw instead. There have
been rumblings on the Cygwin mailing list about discontinuation for
-mno-cygwin support, but it is still being updated.

<h2><A NAME="credits"></A>The Gnumex archive: development and credits</h2>

<p>This page introduces an archive of routines that I have packaged,
called "gnumex".  You can find the latest version via the <A
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex">gnumex project
SourceForge page</A>. The routines are released under the GNU general
public licence.  Gnumex allows you to set up the Windows
versions of gcc to compile mex files. In the archive are some perl
scripts, a Matlab ui setup routine and a couple of supporting mex file
dlls, with source.  Original scripts and some working mex option .bat
files were written by Ton van Overbeek. Lars Gregerson and Mark
Levedahl have offered helpful modifications. Christian Merkwirth
helped with getting C++ compiles working. Thanks also to Mumit Khan
for helpful discussion on dll issues. The original scripts first
appeared on the Cygnus (now Cygwin) mailing list. </p>

<h2><A NAME="mingw_install"></A>Installing Mingw</h2>

<p>This is exceptionally easy; have a look first at the <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml">Mingw dowload page</a>. In
essence it is more or less as easy as just downloading the Mingw
executable MingW installer available via links from the <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/">Mingw site</a>, and unpacking into a
suitable directory, perhaps 'c:\mingw'.  The current version at time
of writing is MingW-3.1.0-1.exe.

<h2><A NAME="cygwin_install"></A>Installing Cygwin</h2>

<em>Warning: cygwin mex files compiled with the current cygwin gcc (3.3)
cause matlab to crash.  </em>You will need to get hold of an earlier (3.2)
version of cygwin gcc for this to work.

<h3><A NAME="cygwin_install_1"></A>Step 1: Install Cygwin</h3>

The version that you want is available via the <a
href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII4.0/cygwin.htm">Ptolemy
cywgin page</a>.  Get the <a
href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptII4.0/cygwinDevel.exe">CygwinDevel.exe</a>
version from there, and install as described in that page.

<h3><A NAME="cygwin_install_fix"></A>Step 2: fix some little installation problems</h3>

There are two little gotchas for Cygwin installations that come up
with windows 9x. The first is an "Out of environment space" error that
can occur when running the bash shell via the cygwin.bat file. If you
get this, you can get round it using one of two methods. The first is
to increase the environment space for any shell: edit your config.sys
file, adding a line like "shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p" (if C: is
your system drive letter). The second is to edit the memory properties
of the cygwin.bat file, which starts up Cygwin bash. Right click on
the cygwin.bat file name in Windows Explorer, choose properties from
the menu, and the Memory tab in the dialog box. Change the Initial
Environment value to 4096K. The second issue that may come up with
Windows 9x is that you may have problems running cygwin.bat if you
have spaces in the filenames in your PATH variable; on my system this
gave me an error message like "Too many parameters; Bad command or
file name". If you have this problem then try putting inverted commas
round the right hand side of the PATH= line in cygwin.bat (but don't
do this in NT...).  </p>

<p><a name="dllpath"></a>Also consider putting cygwin1.dll somewhere
on your windows path, so your mex files can run outside Matlab
sessions started in Cygwin bash.  Be careful if you copy the
cygwin1.dll to somewhere outside its rightful home in the Cygwin
distribution; you will at very least have to be careful to update this
version of the cygwin1.dll file each time you update the Cygwin
distribution, otherwise you will get odd effects from the clashes of
the old dll with the new version.

</p><p>You should now have a working installation of Cygwin and its very
useful version of the Bourne Again Shell, bash. </p>

<h2><A NAME="install_gnumex"></A>For Mingw, or Cygwin: installing the gnumex archive</h2>

<p>Obtain the gnumex archive via the <A
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnumex">gnumex project
SourceForge page</A>.  Unpack the archive (using tar, winzip, whatever) into a
directory of your choice - say c:\gnumex. You now have: a Matlab
install routine, gnumex.m; a couple of mex file supporting routines
(shortpath.dll, uigetpath.dll); a hacked version of the windows dll
utility, dlltool, and some perl scripts. The source for the mex files
are in the the src subdirectory. For convenience, you might consider
putting the directory containing gnumex.m and the dlls onto your
Matlab path.

</p><h3><A NAME="dlltool_aside"></A>A little technical aside</h3>

<p>The hacked version of dlltool is to allow linking of fortran
routines to the matlab 5 fortran libraries - see <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2001-12/msg00471.html">a
general description of the problem</a>.  The patch applied to create
the hacked version of dlltool is also included.  The patch is to the
<a href="binutils-2.11.92-20011113-src.tar.bz2">binutils
2.11.92 source</a>.

</p><h2><A NAME="matlab_steps"></A>Set up Matlab for gcc mex file compilation</h2>

<p>The gnumex script will write a bat file that configures the mex
compiling routine to use gcc. When you run mex from Matlab, or from
the command line, you run the file mex.bat in the Matlab bin
directory. This is a strange combination of bat file and perl script,
that reads key variables out of another bat file to get compile and
link options. This options bat file is by default called mexopts.bat,
and may well reside in your Matlab bin directory. You can tell which
options file mex is using by running "mex -v" from the Matlab
prompt. </p>

<p>To run the gnumex script, start Matlab, change directory to the
gnumex directory you selected earlier (e.g c:\gnumex above). Then type
"gnumex" from the Matlab prompt. A Matlab figure window comes up, with
a variety of options, which should look a little like this:
</p><p>

</p><center><img src="gnumex.png"></center>

<p>

The top edit box needs to contain the path of the Cygwin directory -
here c:\cygwin. Set this to point to your installation of Cygwin if
you have it.  The next edit box should point to the root directory of
MingW - here c:\mingw.  Set this if you have installed MingW.  The
"Path to gnumex file utilities" edit box sets the directory with the
gnumex files (default - the current working directory). There is also
an edit box for the name of the options bat file to be created. You
might want to leave this as the default, which is Matlab's default
mexopts location for your system or account.</p>

<p>Note also there is a list box for selecting Mingw or
Cygwin, or the hybrid Cygwin/mingw compiling/linking:
</p><p>

</p><center><img src="linkopts.png"></center>

<p> If you want to use Cygwin compiles, choose the Cygwin option in
this list box, and make sure the top (Cygwin root path) box is set to
your Cygwin root directory.  If you want to use Mingw, select the
Mingw option in this list box, and check you have the right "Mingw
root path" set.  Choose the Cygwin/mingw option for Cygwin/mingw
hybrid compiles; this option uses the "Cygwin root path" directory.

</p><p> A second list box selects whether the opt file is for creating
mex files (dlls), or standalone Matlab engine exe files. The default
is Mex dll. The third box specifies the language for the compile
(C/C++ or fortran).  There is also a list box selecting Safe or Quick
compiles; this has an associated precompiled library directory edit
box. For the moment, leave the list box at it's default value.  See <a
href="#Tip3">Tip 3</a> for more details on Quick compiles.  Lastly,
you have the option to compile for a the various pentium chips; see
the <a href="#optim_mex">section on optimized compiles</a> for more
details; for the moment leave this option as "All".

</p><p>After you have set the directories correctly, you may want to
save this configuration, using the File-Save config menu option. When
it starts up, the gnumex script will look for a default configuration
file called gnumexcfg.mat in the same directory as the gnumex.m file,
so you could save the file in this directory to get these same options
on startup.

</p><p>When the directories are as you wish, click on the Make opts button
at the bottom of the figure, or choose the Make opts file option from
the File menu of the figure. The script creates the bat file you
specified.

</p><h2><A NAME="test_compile"></A>A test mex file compilation</h2>

<p>The next thing to do is try a test compile.  Before trying, a quick
note about mex files compiled using Cygwin linking.  If you run a mex
file created with Cygwin, then the mex file (which will be a .dll)
will need to be able to call functions in the cygwin1.dll, so this
will need to be somewhere on the Windows path when the mex file
runs. If it isn't, then when you run the mex file, you will get an
error message like:

</p><pre>Error loading cygwin1.dll from c:\gnumex\yprime.dll.
Error loading c:\gnumex\yprime.dll.
??? Invalid MEX-file
</pre>

So, if you are using Cygwin compiles, either arrange to put the
cygwin1.dll on the standard path (see <a href="#dllpath">above</a>),
or run matlab from a Cygnus bash shell, to achieve the same effect.

<p>You should now be able to try a mex file compile. At the Matlab
&gt;&gt; prompt, type

</p><pre>mex -f mexopts.bat c:\progra~1\matlab\extern\examples\mex\yprime.c
</pre>

Where "c:\progra~1\matlab" is your Matlab root directory, and
mexopts.bat is the name of the file you have just created in the
current working directory. <p></p>

<p>Type "which yprime" to check that you do indeed have a new
"yprime.dll" in your current directory. Check the function by calling
it with "yprime(1, 1:4)".  You should get: </p>

<pre>ans =

2.0000 8.9685 4.0000 -1.0947 </pre>

<p>With luck you are now up and running. If you want to make gcc your
default mex compiler, copy the options file you have just created to
overwrite the current default options file (see which this is with
"mex -v"). If there is no default file listed by "mex -v", copy the
file to mexopts.bat in the Matlab bin directory. 

</p><p>For engine / mat file compiles, instead of mex file compiles, just
create an opt file with "Engine exe" selected in the the "Generate mex
dll or engine exe?"  list box:
</p><p>

</p><center><img src="typeopts.png"></center>

<p>

You might want to use a different file name for the engine opt file -
say engopts.bat.

</p><p>Below are a couple of optional extra tips to configure your
system. </p>

<h2><A NAME="mex_optimize"></A>Optimizing gcc compilation for mex files</h2>

(With many thanks to Alberto Martinez). There are a large number of
different flags which can be used with gcc to optimize code for speed;
these are described in the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/gcc.html">gcc
documentation</a>.  The optimization options specified by default in
the gnumex package are the following:

<pre>-O3 -mcpu=pentium -malign-double -fno-exceptions
</pre>

which are all relatively benign.  However, you may well get
considerably greater speed improvements by adding the following flag:

<pre>-ffast-math
</pre>

This option sacrifices some input checking for faster floating point
maths - and is in fact part of the standard (-O2) optimization for
Microsoft Visual C++.  However, to quote from the gcc documenatation:
"This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed. For
example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the sqrt
function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
are NaNs. This option should never be turned on by any `-O' option
since it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for math
functions."

<p>Note also that you may get major gains in speed from optimizing for
a particular processor.  You can use the "Processor to
compile for" list box in the gnumex window to choose other processors
to compile for.  Note that the default "All" option here will work for
any cpu (after a 486), but - for example - the pentium 3 option will
only run on a pentium 3 or higher.

<p>The pentium 4 has particularly fast floating point instructions
which can be enabled with the "Pentium 4" option in the
list box.  This has the advantage of avoiding a very nasty
slowdown for the Pentium 4 when it encounters NaN values.  See <a
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/spm_intel_tune.html">a
pentium 4 compilation</a> page for more details.

</p><h2><A NAME="fortran_compile"></A>Fortran compilation</h2>

The GNU compiler collection includes a Fortran compiler, g77.  g77
seems to be able to compile the example mex and engine files for
matlab 5.3, 6.1 and 6.3; I would be very glad to hear of any problems
with other versions of matlab, or Fortran files.  To try the Fortran
compilation, select the Fortran option in the Gnumex window:

<p>

</p><center><img src="langopts.png"></center>

<p>


and create a new opts.bat file.  Then try:

</p><pre>mex -f mexopts.bat c:\progra~1\matlab\extern\examples\mex\yprimefg.f c:\progra~1\matlab\extern\examples\mex\yprimef.f 
</pre>

Followed by "yprimefg(1, 1:4)" at the matlab prompt.  You should get
the same answer as above.

<h2><A NAME="lapack_link"></A>Linking to LAPACK/BLAS libraries</h2>

Mex files doing a lot of matrix algebra are likely to benefit from
linking to the highly optimized <a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/">BLAS</a> and <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> routines. In matlab
6.0 and higher, these are provided using <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> libraries.  Linking
steps are described in a <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_external/ch04cr16.shtml">Mathworks BLAS/LAPACK help page</a>.  For gcc, you simply
follow the instructions on that page, but use the Microsoft MSVC++
import libraries to link to; e.g, from the matlab prompt:

<pre>mex myfile.c c:/matlab6p5/extern/lib/win32/microsoft/msvc60/libmwlapack.lib
</pre>

You may on occasion want to link a c file to a fortran object file,
which then links to the ATLAS routines; in this case, compile the
fortran file with the "-fno-underscoring" flag; e.g - outside matlab:

<pre>g77 -fno-underscoring -c my_fortran_file.f  
</pre>

Then, inside matlab:

<pre>mex myfile.c my_fortran_file.o c:/matlab6p5/extern/lib/win32/microsoft/msvc60/libmwlapack.lib
</pre>

<h2><A NAME="autotools"></A>Using autotools with gnumex</h2>

Christopher Hulbert has kindly written a page on using <a href="autotools">GNU autotools
with gnumex</a>.  GNU autotools (autoconf and automake) allow you to
script platform independent compilation which is often useful for
larger projects. 

<h2><A NAME="gdb"></A>Debugging mex files with gdb</h2>

Please see this helpful <a href="gdb.txt">text file by Mark
Levedahl</a>.

<h2><A NAME="problems"></A>Current problems</h2>

The latest version of gnumex outputs a warning when compiling engine
(exe) files with cygwin; this looks something like:

<pre>
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-cygwin/3.3.1/../../../../i686-pc-cygwin/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _WinMainCRTStartup; defaulting to 00401000
</pre>

It <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2003-09/msg01083.html">may
be harmless</a>; I would be pleased to hear from anyone with feedback
on this.

<p>A second problem is that mex dll files compiled with cygwin can
crash matlab if reloaded.  You can reproduce this problem thus:

<pre>
>> yprime
>> clear yprime
>> yprime
</pre>

where yprime.dll has been compiled with cygwin.dll linking.  This
appears to be a <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-06/msg01399.html">problem with dynamic cygwin.dll loading and unloading</a>.

<h2><A NAME="tip_path"></A>Tip 1: Put the Matlab bin directory on your path</h2>

<p>To call the mex scripts, or start Matlab, from a Cygwin bash or 9x/NT
console window, you will need to put the Matlab bin directory on your
path. If you will just want to call mex from the Cygwin bash shell,
then you can add the matlab \bin directory path to your cygwin.bat
startup file, which is in your Cygwin directory (default
c:\Cygwin). Edit the line: </p>

<p>SET PATH=c:\Cygwin\bin;%PATH% </p>

<p>to read: </p>

<p>SET PATH=c:\Cygwin\bin;c:\progra~1\matlab\bin;%PATH% </p>

<p>where c:\progra~1\matlab is your Matlab root directory. If you want
to call Matlab or mex from the NT/9x console prompt, as well as bash,
then add the c:\progra~1\matlab\bin (or similar) to the PATH statement
in your autoexec.bat file (for Windows 9x), or add it to your path
variable using the Control panel -&gt; System -&gt; Environment tab in
NT. In NT you might set the variable PATH in your User Variables
settings to; </p>

<p>c:\progra~1\matlab\bin;%PATH% </p>

<h2><A NAME="bash_mex"></A>Tip 2: If using Cygwin: Set up bash to call mex.bat
smoothly</h2>

<p>In its default configuration, the Cygwin bash shell will not
recognize "mex" as being a command. To run the mex compiler from bash
you will need to type "mex.bat &lt;file.c&gt;", where &lt;file.c&gt;
is the file you want to compile. The ".bat" extension tells bash that
it should run a DOS shell to start up mex.bat.  You can automate this
by setting an alias within bash. To do this automatically you need to
get bash to read a startup configuration file when it runs. If you do
not already have one, then create a file called .bashrc, and into it
put the following line:

</p><pre>alias mex="mex.bat"</pre>

To make bash read this startup file:

<p></p>

<ol>

  <li>set the environment variable "HOME" to some directory, such as
      "c:\home\myname", where you want to store your startup file. Do this
      using the
      Control panel -&gt; System -&gt; Environment tab in NT, or by
      editing your
      autoexec.bat file in Windows 9x. 

  </li><li>Copy the .bashrc file to the directory named in HOME. </li>

</ol>

<p>Now when you run bash, it should read this file and set the alias
for "mex".  Don't forget to use Unix pathnames when calling mex from
bash, e.g. "mex c:/progra~1/matlab/extern/examples/mex/yprime.c" </p>

<h2><A NAME="fast_mex"></A>Tip 3: Faster mex file compiling</h2>

<p>As the scripts are set up by default in versions of matlab before
version 6, the mex file compile routines can be slow. The slowness was
because the scripts emulate the behaviour of the mex file compilation
with other compilers, by re-creating libraries from the matlab.exe and
dll files, for the mex or engine .exe files to link against. These
libraries are created every time a mex file is linked, and this
process can be slow. If you are only running one compile at a time,
the library creation is usually not necessary, as the libraries are
the same for each compilation, as long as the matlab.exe main
executable and its .dlls are the same. Of course they are always the
same unless you have updated your Matlab installation, so a shortcut
is to compile these libraries once only, and store them for all
subsequent mex file compiles. This is how library linking is done for
matlab 6; if you have this version, the quick compile option should be
the default. If you want use quick compilation, then follow the
instructions below: </p>

<ol>

  <li>Make a directory to store the compiled libraries, say 
  c:\gnumex\precomp. 

  </li><li>Run the gnumex.m program, and choose the Quick option from the
      Compile type list box:
      <p>

      </p><center><img src="libopts.png"></center>
      
      <p>

      Set the precompiled directory to, say,
      c:\gnumex\precomp. Save the opts bat file with the Make opts
      button, of menu option. This will create the appropriate opts
bat file, and run a script
  that creates the precompiled libraries in the specified
directory. Mex file
  compiles with this opts bat file should be rather faster than with
  the safer standard mode.

  </p></li><li>If for any reason you update your Matlab installation with a new
  matlab.exe or dlls, then don't forget to rerun the "gnumex" bat creation 
  program, to update the libraries. </li>

</ol>

<p>With this setup, you may run into difficulties with more than one
Matlab mex compilation process running at the same time, in which case
you can return to safe mode. </p>

<h2><A NAME="command_options"></A>Tip 4: setting options from the command line</h2>

Thus far I have described the gnumex GUI.  You can also use gnumex
from the command line.  You should first make sure you have set the
various directories correctly, and have saved the configuration, as
described above.  After this, you can very quickly change your
settings from the command line.  Type:

<pre>
>> gnumex usage
</pre>

for a list of options.  Just as a taster, you can use:

<pre>
>> gnumex mingw
</pre>

to set the default compiles to use gnumex with mingw compiles;

<pre>
>> gnumex cygwin eng
</pre>

to set up cygwin engine (exe) file compilation, and

<pre>
>> gnumex no-cygwin eng fortran optfile=test.bat
</pre>

to write an options file "test.bat" in the current directory, which
has settings for making fortran engine files using cygwin/mingw
compilation.

<h2><A NAME="help"></A>Help</h2>

If you have a problem with the installation of this package, please
first check you have followed the instructions above carefully.  If
you are still in difficulty, consider mailing the gnumex mailing list;
list archives and instructions for posting are available via the <a
href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnumex-users">gnumex
users mailing list</a> page. There is also a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=gnumex-users">gnumex
mailing list archive</a>

If you want support with an installation problem, it will be useful if
you can send details, including the output of

<pre>mex -v -f mexopts.bat c:\progra~1\matlab\extern\examples\mex\yprime.c
</pre>

(see above), and a copy of the options file created by the gnumex
routines - here "mexopts.bat" - all zipped up please.  We also need to
know your version of matlab, which version of Mingw/Cygwin you are
using, and the Windows version.

<p>I hope this page has been useful. Please let me know if you have
any comments on this page, or any problems with the installation, and
I'll try and update these instructions accordingly. </p>

<p>Happy mexxing. </p>
