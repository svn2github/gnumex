SOME COMMENTS ON FORTRAN MEX FILES

INTRODUCTION
  This document extends the information in the accompanying file
  README. Gnumex version 2.0 supports both Fortran 77 (with the g77 compiler)
  and Fortran 90/95 (with either the g95 or gfortran compiler). The following
  guidelines may help clear things regarding Fortran programs.

FORTRAN FILE EXTENSIONS
  Fortran 77 programs and Fortran 90/95 programs in fixed source form should
  have extension .f, but free form Fortran 95 programs must have extension .f90
  (the compilers support also the extension .f95, but Matlab's mex command does
  not, and .f90 is preferred over .f95 anyway).

CASE OPTIONS AND TRAILING UNDERSCORES
  With g77 and g95 Gnumex uses the compile switches -fcase-upper and
  -fno-underscoring (which both g77 and g95 support). The first means that
  exported symbols are translated to all-upper-case in the created .obj files
  (the case used in the source file is thus irrelevant), and the second means
  that trailing underscores are not added to these symbols (which is otherwise
  the default). The Fortran mx and mex-functions of Matlab have all-uppercase
  names (despite the Matlab documentation and demos using mixed-case for them)
  and do not have trailing underscores. If Fortran programs are called from C
  they must therefore be called with all-uppercase.  It would be possible to
  change to using the switch -fcase-preserve, and then C and Fortran could be
  mixed more freely (e.g. by calling C-functions that are not all-upper-case
  from Fortran), but then the gateway routine and all mx and mex functions used
  must be spelled with all-upper-case (MEXFUNCTION and MXGETPR for example). As
  -fcase-lower folds everything to lower case it is not very useful in this
  context.

  In contrast gfortran does not offer the -fcase switches, and in fact defaults
  to the behaviour of -fcase-lower. To circumvent the problem that this causes
  one can use BIND(C,NAME...) clauses in interface blocks for the mx and mex
  functions, e.g. BIND(C,NAME='MXGETPR') (the mx and mex functions are probably
  written in C anyway). The demonstration programs give more details.

POINTERS AND %VAL
  Matlab sends integer memory addresses (pointers) to the gateway routine and
  these must be translated to arrays. In g77 the construct %val may be used, but
  in g95 it is possible to use native pointers. Again the demonstration programs
  give the details.

CYGWIN
  Cygwin with -mno-cygwin switch (which is more or less equivalent to using 
  mingw) currently (2007/8) works with g77 and g95, and can be made to work with
  gfortran with some hacking (see next section). Cygwin (with gcc 3.2) with its
  own libraries, however seems to work only with C and g77.

GFORTRAN WITH -MNO-CYGWIN
  To allow "Cygwin -mno-cygwin" linking to work with gfortran 4.3, the
  mexopts.bat file must be edited to contain the lines: 
    set LIBRARY_PATH=/lib/mingw:/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/4.3.0
    set LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gfortran/lib:/lib:%LIBRARY_PATH%
  In addition one must copy the file dllcrt2.o from /lib/mingw to the current
  directory. For other versions of gfortran suitable ammendments must be made.

DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS
  The demo Fortran programs that come with Matlab some use the %val construct
  but others use instead the functions mxCopyPtrToXXX and mxCopyXXXToPtr. With
  g77 it is much simpler to stick with the %val construct. The example gateway
  routine of Matlab, yprimefg.f (in <matlabroot>\extern\examples\mex) is totally
  incompatible with all the gnu Fotran compilers. However with Gnumex there are
  routines, yprime77.f and yprime95.f90 which are compatible. The first one
  calls the computational routine in yprimef.f, but the second contains a module
  with a computational routine that is called (the yprimef.f that comes with 
  Matlab is actually g77-compatible, but for convenience a similar routine is
  enclosed with Gnumex). The Fortran 90 demo programs include two modules,
  mexinterface_c.f90 and mexinterface.f90. The second one is simpler but does
  not work with gfortran (because of the -fcase issue discussed above), but the
  second one works for both compilers.

RUNNING THE DEMOS
  To try out Fortran mexing use Gnumex to create an options.bat file for
  Fortran, compile with mex and call yprime77 or yprime95. From the Matlab
  prompt one can for instance issue:

      >> gnumex fortran77
      >> mex yprime77.f yprimef.f
      >> yprime77(1, 1:4)
  or:
      >> gnumex g95
      >> mex -c mexinterface.f90
      >> mex yprime95.f90 mexinterface.obj
      >> yprime95(1, 1:4)
  or:
      >> gnumex gfortran
      >> mex -c mexinterface_c.f90
      >> mex yprime95.f90 mexinterface_c.obj
      >> yprime95(1, 1:4)

  and should in each case receive the answer: 2.0000  8.9685  4.0000  -1.0947.
  The compilations of the mexinterface files must come before compiling yprime95
  so that the module files (.mod) are created timely. With g95 either 
  mexinterface module may be used.
