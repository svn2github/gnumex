CHANGES TO GNUMEX BETWEEN VERSIONS 1.11 AND 1.12.

1. The mex-files uigetpath and shortpath have been recompiled and the new
   versions are compatible with, and called if, the Matlab version is >= 7.4.
   Comments at the start of uigetpath.c and shortpath.c have been modified
   (but otherwise these files are unchanged).

2. Gnumex now creates .def-files if needed. Starting with Matlab 7.4 there are
   no libmex.def, libmx.def and libmat.def that come with Matlab. In earlier
   Matlab versions these reside in <matlabroot>\extern\include.

3. The gcc option -mcpu=pentium has been deprecated (from gcc version 3.4.0
   according to "Google"), and instead one Gnumex uses -march=pentium which is 
   also comptible with older gcc versions

4. The -mrtd flag has been removed for Fortran compilation (KJ had a nasty
   crash with a Fortran program using large arrays and could not resolve it
   the -mrtd flag was dropped).

5. The mex file extension was changed from .dll to .mexw32 in Matlab version
   7.1 and the new Gnumex honours this.

6. An anonymous function is used for "fp" instead of inline if the Matlab
   version is >= 7.0 (this speeds up Gnumex).

7. A bug was fixed on line 733 of version 1.11 gnumex.m. When directories were
   nonexistent fp was used without being defined.

8. The switch -funroll-all-loops has been added to Fortran compilation.

9. A potential "year-2000" problem with mlv was fixed. The old definition
   would fail if and when Matlab reaches version 10.

10. The switch -fleading-underscore was removed from Fortran compilation (it
    is the default anyway, and just causes confusion with the switch
    -fno-underscoring, which is necessary)

11. Gnumex now locates both the Cygwin and Mingw folders (or does its best to
    locate them), instead of setting the Mingw folder always to c:\Mingw.

12. Gnumex now defaults to using Mingw instead of Cygwin, unless it finds
    Cygwin and not Mingw, for reasons explained in the README.TXT file.

13. A g77-compatible example mex Fortran program accompanies Gnumex 1.12.

14. A new README file has been written.

Except for no. 1, 13 and 14 these changes all only affect gnumex.m. In
particular, there are no changes to linkmex.pl.
